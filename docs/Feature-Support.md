| Trust              | Not Implemented       | Trust: Will likely **not** be implemented. There is no reason to have a convoluted "social score" at this time. (Implementation may vary based on server operator; Open-source implementations could be cheated).                     |
| Files              | Not Implemented       | Files: Content can only currently be written into the database by an administrator manually; Implementing VRChat's Unity SDK compatibility in order for individual users to be able to upload content is currently being looked into. |
